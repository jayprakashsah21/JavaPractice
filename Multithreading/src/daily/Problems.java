//	7.
//	Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers. Numbers can be 0 or negative.
//
//	For example, [2, 4, 6, 2, 5] should return 13, since we pick 2, 6, and 5. [5, 1, 1, 5] should return 10, since we pick 5 and 5.

//	This problem was asked by Google.
//
//	A unival tree (which stands for "universal value") is a tree where all nodes under it have the same value.
//
//	Given the root to a binary tree, count the number of unival subtrees.
//
//	For example, the following tree has 5 unival subtrees:
//
//	   0
//	  / \
//	 1   0
//	    / \
//	   1   0
//	  / \
//	 1   1
	
//9.	
//	This problem was asked by Facebook.
//
//	Given the mapping a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26, and an encoded message, count the number of ways it can be decoded.
//
//	For example, the message '111' would give 3, since it could be decoded as 'aaa', 'ka', and 'ak'.
//
//	You can assume that the messages are decodable. For example, '001' is not allowed.

//Implement a job scheduler which takes in a function f and an integer n, and calls f after n milliseconds.

Implement an autocomplete system. That is, given a query string s and a set of all possible query strings, return all strings in the set that have s as a prefix.

For example, given the query string de and the set of strings [dog, deer, deal], return [deer, deal].

Hint: Try preprocessing the dictionary into a more efficient data structure to speed up queries.

There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.

For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:

1, 1, 1, 1
2, 1, 1
1, 2, 1
1, 1, 2
2, 2

Given an integer k and a string s, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct characters.

For example, given s = "abcba" and k = 2, the longest substring with k distinct characters is "bcb"
